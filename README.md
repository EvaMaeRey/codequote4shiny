Problem

‘… and therefore you must write your application in JavaScript. And that
can be a problem if you are doing data science, because a lot of the
tools you’re used to might not exist in JavaScript.’
<https://youtu.be/kwLu3hxwn5M?t=318> Winston Chang | Running Shiny
without a server | RStudio (2022)

This is also a problem in terms of *teaching* apps that live on the web.
There is a tools disconnect. <http://www.isi-stats.com/isi/applets.html>

What might be really cool is to make connection between what’s in the
app teaching tool, and real-world data science.

# The goal of codequote4shiny is to:

1.  Allow you to write some awesome R code…
2.  Generate an awesome shiny app that demonstrates something about the
    real world (for starters statistical principles); provide guard
    rails that will focus learners on math/stats (or whatever\!)
    principles of interest.
3.  Quote back the R code; jumping off point; give a taste of what’s to
    come. (Taking off the guard rails and training wheels\!)

Goals are pretty limited.

outcome will be like:

  - pnorm.R app to be included
  - <https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/mytidytuesday/blob/master/2023-02-14-heart/heart_app.R>
  - <https://github.com/EvaMaeRey/mytidytuesday/blob/master/2023-02-14-heart/heart_app_automate.R>
  - <https://daattali.com/shiny/ggExtra-ggMarginal-demo/>

You can install the released version of codequote4shiny from
[CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
#   install.packages("codequote4shiny")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("EvaMaeRey/codequote4shiny")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
# library(codequote4shiny)
## basic example code
```
